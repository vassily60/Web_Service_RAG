# Why create a dedicated python env
We need to create a dedicated backend pyenv to be able to properly manage the package for the test environment


# Virtual env
```bash
python3 -m venv pyharvestbackend
```

# Activation

## Mac
```bash
source ./pyharvestbackend/bin/activate
```

## Windows

```bash
.\pyharvestbackend\Scripts\activate
```

# To deactivate

## Mac
```bash
deactivate
```

## Windows
FIX ME: put windows
```bash
deactivate?????
```

# System
```bash
brew install xxxx
```

# Package
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install boto3
pip install requests
```
